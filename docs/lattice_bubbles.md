# Bubbles on a Lattice

## Example code

An example of creating a lattice, attaching with bubbles_interior and do various verifications (bubbles causality, bubbles_interior outside of a given lattice, ...) as well as performing Isometry3 transformations on both the lattice and the bubbles can be found at [lattice_bubbles.py](./examples/lattice_bubbles.py)

### Read bubbles from input file in CartesianLattice

> Distributions of bubble centers

> Bubbles at a given time slice
![bubble at fixed time](./examples/figures/many_bubbles/many_bubbles_at_time_cartesian.png)

### Generate bubbles from SphericalLattice

> Bubbles at a given time slice
